How do international graduate students navigate career uncertainty in a system not designed for them?

That question drives my work as a **Graduate Global Impact Consultant** at UT Austin's Office of Career & Life Design, where I design and facilitate workshops grounded in Stanford's Life Design methodology — adapted for the unique constraints international students face.

## The Problem

International graduate students operate under structural constraints that most career programming ignores: visa timelines, cultural adjustment, unfamiliar professional norms, and limited access to U.S. networks. Generic career advice often falls flat because it assumes a context these students don't share.

## The Approach

I drew on **Gregory Walton's belonging intervention research** and **Stanford Life Design principles** to create workshops that do three things:

1. **Normalize uncertainty** — reframing career ambiguity as a design problem, not a personal failure
2. **Build belonging** — creating peer connection through structured small-group activities
3. **Scaffold action** — breaking overwhelming job search processes into concrete, manageable steps

## Workshop Programming

### Coffee & Connections
A recurring networking series designed to lower the social barrier to professional relationship-building. Each session pairs structured prompts with informal conversation, helping students practice networking in a low-stakes environment.

### International Job Summit
A comprehensive workshop addressing the specific challenges of international job searching — from OPT/CPT timelines to employer sponsorship conversations. Designed with evidence-based intervention principles to build both knowledge and self-efficacy.

## Design Principles

Every workshop follows a consistent structure:

- **Open with reframing** — challenge a limiting assumption
- **Introduce a tool** — something students leave with and can use immediately
- **Practice together** — guided activity, not passive listening
- **Close with commitment** — one specific action before next week

> The goal is not to give answers, but to build the capacity to navigate questions.

## What I Learned

Designing for international students taught me that **effective interventions must account for cultural context**. A growth mindset message lands differently depending on someone's relationship to failure, authority, and self-advocacy — all of which are culturally shaped.

This insight directly informs my thesis research on health communication among Korean American midlife women, where culturally embedded communication patterns shape how people seek — or avoid — help.
