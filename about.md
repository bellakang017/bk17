I study why health messages reach some people and miss others — and what culturally embedded beliefs have to do with that gap.

## Research Focus

I research communication patterns — especially self-silencing and help-seeking — among Korean American midlife women. How culturally specific communication styles interact with stress, coping, and access to care. I use mixed methods (qualitative + quantitative) to bridge lived experience and measurable outcomes.

## How I Think About Interventions

My work is grounded in psychologically wise interventions — small shifts in how people interpret their circumstances can redirect self-defeating patterns into self-enhancing ones. I follow a full-cycle model: field observation → theory → experimentation → back to the field.

> How do we design messages that work *with* — not against — the cognitive and cultural contexts people actually inhabit?
